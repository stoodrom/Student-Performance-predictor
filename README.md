# Student-Performance-predictor
## Business Problem:
Educational institutions often struggle to monitor and improve student performance, which can lead to missed opportunities for academic excellence and resource optimization. This project aims to address this challenge by predicting student academic outcomes and providing actionable recommendations to enhance performance.

## Objective:
Develop a predictive model to forecast student performance based on historical data.
Create a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize predictions, insights, and personalized recommendations.
Enable data-driven decision-making for stakeholders (e.g., educators, administrators, and students).

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Questions:
## Average Predicted vs. Actual Grades:

### KPI Question: What is the average predicted grade compared to the actual grade?
### Solution:
Averages of predicted (10.60) and actual grades (11.81) were computed and displayed to evaluate model accuracy and highlight areas for performance improvement.
### Insight: 
On average, the predictive model closely aligns with actual grades, showcasing its reliability.
Student Progress Tracking:

### KPI Question: How do grades progress across the first, second, and final evaluation periods?
### Solution: 
A line chart visualizes student progress by roll number for grades (G1, G2, and G3).
### Insight: 
This visualization identifies students who consistently underperform or improve, guiding targeted interventions.
Impact of Study Time on Internet Usage:

### KPI Question: How does internet access correlate with study time and academic outcomes?
### Solution:
A bar chart visualizes the relationship between study time categories and internet availability.
### Insight: 
Students with longer study hours (category 3) often lack internet access, indicating potential gaps in online resources.
School Support Effectiveness:

### KPI Question: How does extra educational support (schoolup_m) impact grades?
### Solution:
A bar chart compares final grade averages based on support availability.
### Insight:
Students receiving additional school support perform better, highlighting its value.

## Recommendation Patterns:

### KPI Question: What personalized actions can improve student performance?
### Solution: 
A table lists students, their grades, and tailored recommendations (e.g., increasing study time, reducing absences).
### Insight:
Recommendations focus on areas like health, study routines, and attendance for actionable improvement.

## Demographics Analysis:

### KPI Question: What is the gender distribution among students?
### Solution: 
A donut chart shows the male-to-female ratio.
### Insight:
Gender-balanced participation ensures equitable insights for all student groups.

# Insights and Conclusion:
### Performance Trends: 
Students with consistent study routines and fewer absences outperform their peers, emphasizing discipline and regularity in academics.
### Targeted Interventions: 
Tailored recommendations, such as increasing study time or leveraging school support, drive measurable improvements in grades.
### Resource Allocation: 
Identified gaps in internet access and highlighted the need for additional resources in specific student groups.
### Actionable Outcomes: 
The dashboard empowers educators to make informed decisions and optimize interventions for at-risk students.
